- Origin
Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden.
 Bootstrap released as an open source project on August 19, 2011. It has continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, as well as a large community of contributors.
On January 31, 2012, Bootstrap 2 was released, which added a twelve-column responsive grid layout system, inbuilt support for Glyphicons, several new components, as well as changes to many of the existing components.
On August 19, 2013, Bootstrap 3 was released, which redesigned components to use flat design, and a mobile first approach.
On October 29, 2014, Mark Otto announced that Bootstrap 4 was in development.The first alpha version of Bootstrap 4 was released on August 19, 2015.The first beta version was released on 10 August 2017.

- Features
Bootstrap 4 supports the latest versions of the Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari . It additionally supports back to IE8 and the latest Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR).
Since 2.0, Bootstrap supports responsive web design. This means the layout of web pages adjusts dynamically, taking into account the characteristics of the device used (desktop, tablet, mobile phone).
Starting with version 3.0, Bootstrap adopted a mobile-first design philosophy, emphasizing responsive design by default.
The version 4.0 alpha release added Sass and flexbox support.

- Structure and function
Bootstrap is modular and consists of a series of Less stylesheets that implement the various components of the toolkit. These stylesheets are generally compiled into a bundle and included in web pages, but individual components can be included or removed. Bootstrap provides a number of configuration variables that control things such as color and padding of various components.
Since Bootstrap 2, the Bootstrap documentation has included a customization wizard which generates a customized version of Bootstrap based on the requested components and various settings.
As of Bootstrap 4, Sass is used instead of Less for the stylesheets.
Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code.
Grid system and responsive design comes standard with an 1170 pixel wide grid layout. Alternatively, the developer can use a variable-width layout. For both cases, the toolkit has four variations to make use of different resolutions and types of devices: mobile phones, portrait and landscape, tablets and PCs with low and high resolution. Each variation adjusts the width of the columns.
